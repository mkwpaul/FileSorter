# FileSorter

This is a small Applet to sort a large amount of Files, although it works the best with images.

# How to use

First
1. Select the Folder which contains your unsorted files.
2. Select the folder which contains the folders which you want to sort your files into.

Now type the name of the Folder you want to move the file to into the Move To text box.
It will probably only take a few letters until the desired Folder is the only one remaining so it isn't necessary to type out the whole name.

 - Press Enter to Move the file to the currently selected folder, which is displayed directly below the text box.
 - Press Shift + Del to delete the file.
 - Press shift + Enter to create a new Folder from the typed text.
 - Press Up + Down to select the destination folder from the remaining ones

Shift + Left, Shift + Right to move to the next/previous file.
  
Note that after you have moved a file, the same destination folder is still selected so if the next file should be moved to the same folder you can just press enter again.

Files that are deleted are moved to the windows reclycle bin and not directly deleted permanently.
